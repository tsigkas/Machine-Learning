    "\n",
    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs. It allows\n",
    "for fast prototyping by providing high level access to all necessary building blocks including NN layers, activation functions, loss functions or optimizers to name a few. Most importantly, however, PyTorch implements the [autograd](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html) package which allows for automatic differentiation of the operations we use to define NN architectures. Put in other words, one only has to implement the forward pass, namely to combine desired layers, while the **backpropagation is computed automatically**.\n",

    "### 1.2: Basic pipeline\n",

    "In order to define and train deep net models, one would usually implement the following steps:\n",

    "    1. Load the dataset.\n",
    "    2. Define and instantiate a deep net architecture.\n",
    "    3. Choose or implement a loss function (such as the mean squared error).\n",

    "        5.3. Compute the loss.\n",
    "        5.4. Run backward pass, i.e. compute gradients of the loss w.r.t. the trainable parameters (weights).\n",
    "        5.5. Update the weights using the optimizer.\n",

The optimization criterion of choice is then to minimize the [**cross-entropy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy) (CE) of $\\zb'$ and $\\yb$, therefore our final loss function $L$ is defined as:\n",
