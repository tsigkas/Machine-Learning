# Machine-Learning
Projects made while attending the course "Introduction to Machine Learning" at EPFL, using the following algorithms in Python:

- K means clustering

- k-Nearest-Neighbors (kNN) 

- Logistic Regression and Kernel Regression methods

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Deep Learning - MLP's & CNN's

- Dimensionality reduction with PCA & LDA
